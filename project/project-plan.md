# Project Plan

## Title

Correlation Analysis of Health Datasets

## Main Question

What insights can be derived from exploring the interconnections and correlations within Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Hepatitis C, and Arterial Disease/Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Electronic Health Records (EHRs)?

## Description

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of three distinct Electronic Health Records (EHRs) datasets: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) from Abu Dhabi, Hepatitis C from Japan, and Arterial Disease/IBD from France. By leveraging data analytics, statistical methods, and machine learning, we intend to identify correlations, commonalities, and potential insights that may arise from the integration and analysis of these diverse health datasets. The project seeks to contribute to a better understanding of the relationships among these health conditions, providing valuable information for healthcare professionals and researchers.
