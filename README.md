# Correlation Analysis of Health Datasets

This project is all about exploring connections and patterns within health records from different placesâ€”like those with Chronic Kidney Disease in Abu Dhabi, Hepatitis C in Japan, and Arterial Disease/Inflammatory Bowel Disease in France. We're on a mission to uncover valuable insights by cleaning up the data, studying it closely, and using smart techniques to find meaningful relationships between health conditions. Ultimately, our goal is to provide healthcare experts and researchers with fresh insights that can deepen our understanding of these health issues. It's like solving a puzzle to make healthcare knowledge richer and more useful.
